#Mobile-First Webpage Challenge

##Welcome!

So this Challenge, in the User Centric Front End Module of the 
FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPMENT COURSE, was to build a reponsive wepage with 
the mobile-first approach.

The instructions were as follows:

Using a mobile-first approach, make a webpage responsive in line with the 
following guidelines. In the hint tab, you'll find a link to 
boilerplate files to help get you started. (N.B Not used or looked at.)

1. Make the div elements 30% of the window size. Now make this change only for 
    the devices that are wider than or equal to 992px.

2. Set the margin to 10px on all sides for each column for the devices that 
    are wider than or equal to 992px.

3. Keep the full-size width for the devices below the 992px.
 
4. Remove the left and right amrgin for the devices below the 992px

5. Remember to keep in mind the mobile-first approach
